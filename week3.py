# # Working With Strings


# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
# 2. name
# 3. song
# 4. food
# 5. number
age = 17
name = "manny"
song = "yaminabe"
food = "rice"
number = 777
# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].

print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " old coder " + name)

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.

print(name + " liked to hum the song, " + song + "while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw " + food + "until " + name + " would stop singing." )

# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?

print("still, " + name + "was the best coder on the team and could write, " + str(number) + " lines of code every day. Maybe " + song + "was  " + name + "'s secret power?")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# 1st_name --> first_name
# last name --> last_name
# email@address -->email_address
# percent% --> percent
# variable#name --> variable_name
# O --> zero
# list --> name
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person --> firstName
# The last name of a person --> last_Name
# The email address of a person --> email_address
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student --> percent
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart --> number_items




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name --> valid
# lastName --> valid
# email_address --> valid
# percentage --> valid
# variable_name --> valid
# 1_variable --> invalid
# email@address --> invalid
# percentage% --> invalid
# i --? valid

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #get the max and min of a number
# #round a number
# # absolute value
# # order of operations
# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
# #from math import *    
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method
# #ceil method
# #sqrt method

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together
# #multiply
# # find the max number
# # find the remainder of the numbers
# #round one number
